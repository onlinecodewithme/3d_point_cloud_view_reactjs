## Technical Implementation

### ROS2 Integration

The dashboard subscribes to the following ROS topics:
- `/cognitionbrain/system_monitoring` - Cognition Brain system data
- `/perceptionbrain/system_monitoring` - Perception Brain system data

### Message Format

The system expects JSON-formatted messages with the following structure:

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": 45.2,
  "memory_usage": 67.8,
  "disk_usage": 23.1,
  "temperature": 42.5,
  "network_rx": 1024000,
  "network_tx": 512000,
  "process_count": 156,
  "uptime": 86400,
  "load_average": [0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
}
```

### Chart.js Configuration

The dashboard uses Chart.js with the following registered components:
- CategoryScale, LinearScale
- PointElement, LineElement, BarElement
- Title, Tooltip, Legend
- ArcElement, Filler

### Data Management

- **Historical Data**: Maintains last 50 data points (approximately 4 minutes)
- **Update Frequency**: 5-second intervals for real-time updates
- **Offline Detection**: 10-second timeout for brain offline detection

## Usage

### Navigation

Access the Enhanced Brain System Monitoring Dashboard through:
- URL: `/enhanced-system-monitoring`
- Navigation Menu: "Enhanced Brain Monitor" (ðŸ§  icon)

### Controls

#### Time Range Selector
- 1 Minute
- 5 Minutes (default)
- 15 Minutes
- 1 Hour

#### Focus Metric Selector
- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Temperature
- Network Activity

### Health Status Indicators

#### System Health Colors
- ðŸŸ¢ **Healthy**: All systems operating normally
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning**: Some metrics approaching thresholds
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: One or more systems require attention

#### Threshold Values
- **CPU Usage**: Good â‰¤50%, Warning â‰¤80%, Critical >80%
- **Memory Usage**: Good â‰¤70%, Warning â‰¤85%, Critical >85%
- **Temperature**: Good â‰¤60Â°C, Warning â‰¤80Â°C, Critical >80Â°C
- **Disk Usage**: Good â‰¤70%, Warning â‰¤90%, Critical >90%

## Styling and Design

### Modern Glassmorphism UI
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effects
- Gradient borders and hover animations
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Dark theme optimized for monitoring environments

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Adaptive grid systems
- Flexible chart containers
- Touch-friendly controls

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: #2196F3 (Blue) - Cognition Brain
- **Secondary**: #FF6B6B (Red) - Perception Brain
- **Success**: #00ff41 (Green) - Healthy status
- **Warning**: #ffaa00 (Orange) - Warning status
- **Error**: #ff4444 (Red) - Critical status

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Efficient data structure management
- Automatic cleanup of historical data
- Optimized chart rendering
- Minimal re-renders with React hooks

### Memory Management
- Limited historical data retention
- Automatic garbage collection of old data points
- Efficient state updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Displayed
1. Check ROS bridge connection (ws://localhost:9090)
2. Verify topic names match exactly
3. Ensure message format is correct JSON
4. Check browser console for connection errors

#### Charts Not Updating
1. Verify WebSocket connection is active
2. Check if data is being received in console logs
3. Ensure Chart.js dependencies are loaded
4. Refresh the page to reset connections

#### Performance Issues
1. Reduce historical data retention period
2. Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
3. Ensure adequate system resources
4. Consider reducing update frequency

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking browser console for:
- "Enhanced System Dashboard: Connected to ROS bridge"
- "Enhanced System Dashboard: Received [brain] data"
- WebSocket connection status messages

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Export functionality for historical data
- Alert system with email/SMS notifications
- Custom threshold configuration
- Multi-robot support
- Performance benchmarking tools
- System diagnostics integration

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom metrics
- Configurable chart types
- Custom color themes
- Advanced filtering options

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
