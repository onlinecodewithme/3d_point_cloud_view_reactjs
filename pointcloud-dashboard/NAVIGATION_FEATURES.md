- **RTAB-Map Path Planning**: Alternative path planning using RTAB-Map
- **Goal Cancellation**: Stop navigation at any time
- **Navigation Monitoring**: Real-time status updates during navigation

### 5. User Interface Enhancements
- **Split-Panel Layout**: Control panel on left, 3D visualization on right
- **Collapsible Sections**: Organized controls with expandable sections
- **Real-time Status**: Connection status and data statistics
- **Interactive Controls**: Intuitive buttons and sliders for all features

## Technical Implementation

### ROS Topics Used
- `/cloud_map` - 3D point cloud data (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)
- `/map` - 2D occupancy grid (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)
- `/move_base_simple/goal` - Navigation goals (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)
- `/plan` - Navigation path (nav_msgs/Path)
- `/move_base/status` - Navigation status (actionlib_msgs/GoalStatusArray)

### ROS Services Used
- `/save_map` - Save current map (nav2_msgs/SaveMap)
- `/rosapi/topics` - Topic discovery (rosapi/Topics)

### Key Components

#### NavigationControlPanel
- Manages waypoint creation, selection, and navigation
- Handles map saving/loading operations
- Provides 3D visualization of waypoints and paths
- Integrates with ROS navigation stack

#### EnhancedPointCloudVisualization
- Main component combining all features
- Manages ROS connections and data flow
- Coordinates between 3D visualization and control panels
- Handles real-time data updates

#### OccupancyGridRenderer
- Renders 2D occupancy data in 3D space
- Optimized for performance with large maps
- Supports transparency and color coding
- Filters occupied cells for efficient rendering

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Starting the System
1. Launch your ROS2 system with RTAB-Map and Nav2
2. Start the rosbridge server: `ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml`
3. Start the dashboard: `npm start`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Basic Navigation Workflow
1. **Enable Mapping**: Toggle mapping in the 3D Mapping section
2. **Wait for Map Data**: Ensure both point cloud and occupancy data are received
3. **Add Waypoints**: Click "Add Waypoint" then click on the map
4. **Navigate**: Select a waypoint and click "Navigate Here"
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time navigation status and path

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Save Waypoint Sets**: Create reusable waypoint collections
- **Map Management**: Save maps for different environments
- **Path Planning**: Automatic obstacle avoidance during navigation
- **Real-time Updates**: Live path updates as obstacles change

### 4. Troubleshooting
- **No Map Data**: Check ROS topics are publishing (`ros2 topic list`)
- **Navigation Fails**: Verify Nav2 is running and configured
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure rosbridge is running on port 9090
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce point cloud density or map resolution
